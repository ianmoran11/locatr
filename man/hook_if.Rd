\title{Supply an expression to identify which header groups are hooked.}
\usage{
hook_if(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{expression applied to a  identifies which header groups are hooked}
}
\description{
This function is used with the \code{.hook_if} or \code{.hook_if_rev}
arguments in the \code{locate_groups} function.
This expression must evaluate to a single value for each header group.
For example, see below that any(fmt_alignment_indent == 0) is used rather that
fmt_alignment_indent == 0.

It passes an expression to \code{dplyr::summarise} that identifies which header groups are hooked
\itemize{
\item for example swiched from N to NNW.
See the the \code{locate_groups} documentation for more information and an example.
