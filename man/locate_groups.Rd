\arguments{
\item{sheet}{data frame created by xlsx_cells}

\item{direction}{a string indicating which type of headers are to be labelled. Options include
compass direction or up/down/left/right.}

\item{.groupings}{expressions representing how header cells are differentiated. Most naturally
works with fmt_* functions.
These expressions must be provided within \code{groupings}.}

\item{.hook_if}{expression determining whether directions are hooked. That is, whether a header
cell to the left of data cells should be
annotated as "W" or "WNW". This argument contains an expression within the function \code{hook}.
This expression must evaluate to a single value for each header group.
For example, see below that any(fmt_alignment_indent == 0)
is used rather that fmt_alignment_indent == 0.}

\item{.hook_if_rev}{expression determining whether directions are hooked.
That is, whether a header cell to the left of data cells should be
annotated as "W" or "WNW". This argument contains an expression within the function \code{hook}.
This expression must evaluate to a single value for each header group.
For example, see below that any(fmt_alignment_indent == 0)
is used rather that fmt_alignment_indent == 0.}

\item{default_col_header_direction}{Indicates which direction is given to col headers by default.
Only need if "NNW" is required, rather than "N".}

\item{default_row_header_direction}{Indicates which direction is given to row headers by default.
Only need if "WNW" is required, rather than "W".}

\item{header_fill}{deals with merged cells. Fills in neighbouring cells if they have the same
"local_format_id", "style" or are within "borders".}

\description{
This function adds direction annations to tidyxl data frame, specifying annotions for
several headers at once.
The resulting data frame will contain the following columns: \code{.value}, \code{.direction},
and \code{.header_label}.
These columns indicate the value, direction and name of the header columns that will be
produced in the tidy data frame produced by \code{migrate}.
